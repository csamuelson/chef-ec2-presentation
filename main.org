* Running Rails Apps in the Cloud
** Introduction
*** Introduction
**** Who - Me
**** Why
***** To describe running an app with cloud infrastructure by working through a concrete example
*** Commodity Infrastructure
**** Isn't this just a VPS with a cool name?
     * Some of the providers offer compute capacity in the cloud
       * Amazon, Rackspace Cloud and others offer computing in the cloud that is very similar to a VPS except:
     	 * No setup fees
	 * No long-term contracts
	 * Pay for resource use in very granular ways (by the hour, instead of by the month)
	 * Increase of decrease usage very quickly, and in an automated fashion.
       * Google and Salesforce are good examples of companies that offer computing resources that are very dis-similar to a tradtional VPS
	 * No software setup
	 * Many common tasks are services (image processing, data storage, etc)
	 * No need to manage capacity (ie. turn up or down servers), that is taken care of for you
     * You could use something like Rackspace Cloud or Amazon Web Services just like a tradional VPS, but you would be missing the point!
*** Not just about the hardware...
**** Introduce Configuration Management and Deployment Automation
     * Q. Now that you have freely scalable resources what are you going to do with them?
     * A. Configuration Management, and Deployment Automation to the rescue!
